Sign Language Detection using ACTION RECOGNITION with Python | LSTM Deep Learning Model 
'A practical implementation of sign language estimation using an LSTM NN built on TF Keras.'

You'll be able to leverage a keypoint detection model to build a sequence of keypoints which can then be passed to an action detection model to decode sign language! As part of the model building process you'll be able to leverage Tensorflow and Keras to build a deep neural network that leverages LSTM layers to handle the sequence of keypoints.

In this you'll learn how to: 
1. Extract MediaPipe Holistic Keypoints
2. Build a Sign Language model using a Action Detection powered by LSTM layers
3. Predict sign language in real time using video sequences

4. Happy coding!
